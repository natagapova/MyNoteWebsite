<h1>How to use?</h1>
<p>
	This is a website for creating notes!! On the "Notes" page you can create and overview your
	created notes. You can also open each note in case you need a closer look on it or if you want to
	show it to your friends without showing your other personal data that you may have on this
	website!
</p>
<p>
	You can also track your mood and your habits, such as drinking water, eating, and resting. Also,
	if you want to delete your note, you can easily do that by opening the note.
